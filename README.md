# Introduction
Currently living in the DC area and passionate about real estate and construction, I want to analyze and understand the different criteria that define the selling price for residential properties.
The real estate market is every growing with properties more and more expensive.
The goal of this study is to identify the parameters that influence the selling price

# Hypothesis / Research Question(s)
- What are the attributes that affect the housing selling prices in DC downtown?
- Are structural characteristics playing a role in the selling price?
- Is there any pattern/reason as to why the housing selling prices are rising over the years?

# Dataset
The dataset contains attribution on housing and structural characteristics for residential properties.
